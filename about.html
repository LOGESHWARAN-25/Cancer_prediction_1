        In collaboration with RMKCET College, we have developed a groundbreaking website aimed at cancer diagnosis through image analysis. This innovative platform allows users to upload medical images, enabling quick and efficient identification of potential cancerous conditions. The primary focus of the website is on predicting four types of cancer: lung cancer, brain cancer, kidney cancer, and oral cancer.

        The core objective of this project is to provide a valuable and accessible tool to aid in the early detection of cancer, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and increase the chances of successful treatment. By leveraging advanced image recognition and machine learning algorithms, the website can analyze uploaded images with precision and accuracy, helping users determine whether cancer may be present in affected areas.

        The endeavor is driven by a genuine desire to make a positive impact on healthcare, and the team is fully committed to providing these crucial services entirely free of cost. Thanks to the generous support and sponsorship from CTS company, the students were able to participate in a hackathon and bring this ambitious project to life.

        By offering this service without any financial burden on the users, the students aim to extend much-needed support to individuals and families affected by cancer. Through this noble initiative, they hope to contribute to the global efforts to combat cancer and improve the lives of countless people.
